To be able to use this Serverless Forge sample app you'd need to [sign up for Autodesk Forge](https://forge.autodesk.com/developer/start-now/signup) and provide a valid access token to the form below - it's strongly advised to follow the instructions [here](https://forge.autodesk.com/developer/learn/twolegged-auth/overview) to obtain a token using the tools/scripts/code of your choice. Should you choose to fill in the client ID and secret below you are advised that all provided information would not be processed, stored, relayed or exposed to any application, service or proxy other than Forge itself - since this sample is completely "Serverless", all communication would strictly occur between your browser and the Forge services directly, without proceeding through a backend or proxy of any kind in order to protect its confidentiality and minimize/prevent exposure to third parties...
